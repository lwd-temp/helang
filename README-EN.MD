# Description

> Nowadays in the 21st century, `Helang`, `Jvav` and `C--` have become the three irreplaceable programming languages.
>
> Saint He. (2202). *A Brief **He**story of Cyber Programming Languages*. Litang Computer Science and Technology Press.

Next generation cyber programming language, born in the **E-SMOKER** town, Cyber Litang.

This program was written by a self-typing 5G keyboard on AirDesk with AirPods in 108 cyber minutes.

It's so cool! What a just fit with my imagination for a better future. Science with delight.

PS: It took about `1! + 5! + 5! + 5! = 361` [BUPTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_University_of_Posts_and_Telecommunications) (Basic Unit of Plain Time) to develop this language.

PS 2: **BUPT** also refers to **Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications** in the cyber world. (Disclaimer: This project is just a satire of a particular person. No malice to the outstanding university!)

# Usage

## Use Without Installation

1. Pull the source code:

   ```bash
   > git clone https://github.com/kifuan/helang.git
   ```

2. Install third-party libraries:

   ```bash
   > pip install -r requirements.txt
   # if need GUI
   > pip install -r requirements-gui.txt
   ```

3. Modify **The Great Script** `helang/great.he`, then run `helang.py` in a `great` way：

   ```bash
   > python helang.py great
   ```

4. You can also launch `helang.py` in `shell` mode, to communicate with **Saint He** in HeLang in Cyber Spaces.

   ```bash
   > python helang.py shell
   ```

   Now, there's no need to append semicolons to the line end: we will do that for you. (Of course, you can choose to use semicolons to show your loyalty to **Saint He**)

   Type `.help` to get the runtime help. Yeah, a copy-paste from `node`'s `REPL Keywords`.

5. **Saint He** is generous. He forgives those who forgets to add startup arguments. So the following command is also valid:

   ```bash
   > python helang.py
   ```

6. Develop with `LTCode`：
   
   ```bash
   > python helang.py editor
   ```
   
   _WIP. New features are planned._
   Only running code in current window is supported, and crashes may occur when frequently doing `print`.
   
## Install Locally

1. Pull the source code：

   ```bash
   > git clone https://github.com/kifuan/helang.git
   ```

2. Install：

   ```bash
   > pip install .
   ```

3. Run

   ```bash
   > helang shell
   ```


PS：
- If you are from Planet Antimony, there is no need to use the stupid technology from sol3 aborigines. You can use 1.14514 sg (supergrams) `nitrane` to trigger the global termination of the Cyber Spaces through the `exprinciple reaction` to run the program directly.
- When you're using **Non-Apple devices** to run, it will raise a warning.
`It seems like you're using a non-Apple device, which is not cool!`
If you want to disable this warning, please use Apple devices.

Attention: This is a very dangerous action with a chance of failing. If there is `chickenium-niobium-titanium-magnesium` nearby when you fail, it will be catalyzed and produce `CH2N8`. This action should be strictly regulated by exprinciple commitee.

# Basic Grammar

**Saint He** noted that every type is `u8`. What does that mean? Reverse it so we get `8u` (Ba You). Does Saint He use Tieba?

Besides, `u8` is similar to `v8` in shape. So follow [Ace Ta↑ffy↓](https://space.bilibili.com/1265680561) nya, follow Ace Taffy thank you nya.


As you can see, we use `|`, **the bitwise or**, to replace the traditional array. **Why are you still using traditional arrays nowadays?** 

```c
u8 a = 1 | 2 | 3;
```

**Saint He** also noted that `whichKey - 1`, so the index starts at `1`.

```c
u8 a = 1 | 2 | 3;
print a[1];
// 1
```

But when you operate against a `u8` variable, you can use index `0` to assign a value to all elements in the array.

```c
u8 a = 1 | 2 | 3;
a[0] = 10;
print a;
// 10 | 10 | 10
```

To catch on with the latest technology, multi-index operations are also supported. No more `for` loops!

```c
u8 a = 1 | 2 | 3;
a[1 | 2] = 0;
print a;
// 0 | 0 | 3
```

Also, we provide a way to initialize an array with a fixed length. Unfortunately, it's traditional. For example, the following code can initialize an array with 5 elements.

```c
u8 a = [5];
print a;
// 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
```

In the end, we can combine all the grammar above to write the following code.

```c
u8 forceCon = [68];

forceCon[1 | 2 | 6 | 7 | 11 | 52 | 57 | 58 | 65] = 10;

print forceCon;
```

Such fine code can't be understood by humans on earth. As a **cyber intelligent life form**, we could only show you the basics.

It's so cool. too long didn't write.

# Hello, Litang.

Some programmers consider Helang as a piece of shit because it can't print `Hello, Litang.` .

But **Saint He** focuses on the development of MCUs. How can he take strings into account?

Well, after consultation, he agreed our request and allowed us to print `Hello, Litang.` in the language.

```c
sprint 72 | 101 | 108 | 108 | 111 | 44 | 32 | 76 | 105 | 116 | 97 | 110 | 103 | 46;
// Hello, Litang.
```

To strictly optimize the performance, We use UTF-8 decimals instead of characters.

By decreasing readability, we gain exponential performance increase. Credits to the real god in the cyber world.

# Print Logo

You may think it too easy to print only `Hello, Litang.` . After all, **it doesn't meet with the science geek's imagination for a better future**.

Actually, you can print HeLang's logo by:
```bash
> python helang.py logo
```

By looking at the source `helang/logo.he`, you will find the code is mostly **numbers**. In Cyber Spaces, complex images can be displayed with simple numbers. **Isn't that cool?**

Besides, you can also print `HeLang Logo` in HeLang code:

```c
logo large;
```

Smaller and Medium? No problem.

```c
logo tiny;

logo medium;
```

In this circumstance, every computation happens in `Helang`. In Cyber Spaces, complex images can be displayed with simple computations. **COOL.**

# Increment

We noticed that increment (`++`) also appeared in the code by **Saint He**.

So, we allow this operation too.

```c
u8 a = 1 | 2 | 3;
a++;
print a;
// 2 | 3 | 4
```

# Addition and Subtraction

**Saint He** said `whichKey - 1`, so now we provide subtraction too.

```c
u8 whichKey = 1 | 2 | 6 | 7;
print whichKey - 1;
// 0 | 1 | 5 | 6
```

Examples of operations between `u8` variables:

```c
u8 a = 1;
u8 b = 1 | 2 | 3;
u8 c = 2 | 4 | 6;
u8 d = 5 | 9;

print a + b;
// 2 | 3 | 4
print b + c;
// 3 | 6 | 9
print b - c;
// -1 | -2 | -3
print b + d;
// helang.exceptions.CyberArithmeticException: illegal operation: 1 | 2 | 3 + 5 | 9
print a - b;
// helang.exceptions.CyberArithmeticException: illegal operation: 1 - 1 | 2 | 3
```

It's so easy for you to figure out which statements are legal, even if you're a **Cyber Spaces newbie**!

# Multiplication

Unlike addition and subtraction, multiplication can be done between **any** two `u8`s. `u8`s will be treated as `vectors`. Isn't it high-tech?

```c
u8 a = 1 | 2;
u8 b = 3 | 4 | 5;
u8 c = 3 | 6 | 9;

print a * b;
// 1*3 + 2*4 + 0*5 = 9
print b * c;
// 3*3 + 4*6 + 5*9 = 68
```

Note: we use dot product ( $\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}$ ), not out product.

# Declarations and Assignments of Variables

In early versions, we only support variable initializations and don't support mutation and declarations. Because **Saint He** loves `immutable`.

After consulting, we can now support them!

```c
// Now we support declarations before assignments. The code below is legal:
u8 a;
a = 1 | 2;

// In early versions only the following code worked, but it still works now.
u8 b = 3 | 4;
```

Warning! If a variable isn't declared or initialized, assigning it will raise `CyberNameException`.

```c
c = 1 | 2 | 3;
// helang.exceptions.CyberNameException: c is not defined.
```

As a high-tech language, we need to be strict and precise.


# Check If You Are in Cyber Spaces

To meet with **Saint He**, you need to be in **Cyber Spaces**. Use the command below to check if you're in position: 

```c
cyberspaces;
// Getting your location...
// Your location is UNITED STATES.
// Congratulations! You are in the Cyber Spaces!
```

Because **Saint He** lives in a cyber wonderland, he may be unable to see `IPv6` clearly, so you may get the error `Failed to resolve IP`.


# 5G Speedtest

It's very simple, and all you need is to start a new line and type: 

```c
test5g;
```

Or an other mode:

```c
test5g app;
```

Then you can start a 5G speedtest from this line.
